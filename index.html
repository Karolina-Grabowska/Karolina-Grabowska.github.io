        <h3>Here's some things you might want to know about me...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> I'm an artist, primarily work on digital art, and known on the internet as a Sonic fanartist!</li>
			<li> I love playing video games and do a lot of fanart for video games!  My favourite games include: Okami, Skyrim, Sonic Adventure 2, Splatoon 2, etc. </li>
			<li> I have an obsession with a fancharacter called Nazo, originating from the Sonic series. I'll spare you the details since it's a long story but here he is!
			<li> I made a fancomic about said character, titled Halo on Fire. It's still a work in progress, but I'm really proud of it, I've been working on it for more than 5 years now.</li>
